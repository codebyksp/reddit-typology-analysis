## General Coding Guidelines

### Decision Rules for Ambiguous Posts:
1. **Identify the primary purpose:** What is the main question or point of the post?
2. **Use the most specific category:** If a post could fit multiple categories, choose the one that best captures the main intent
3. **Consider the context:** Course codes strongly suggest **Course Content**; policy questions suggest **Academic Planning**
4. **When in doubt:** Ask "What is the person primarily seeking?" (content help, system navigation, resources, social connection, etc.)

### Quality Control:
- If a post seems completely unrelated to all categories, code as **Social**
- Very brief or vague posts (e.g., "Thoughts?") should be coded as **Social** unless context clearly indicates otherwise
- Posts with multiple topics should be coded based on the dominant or first-mentioned topic

### Notes on University Context:
- These categories are designed for university subreddit posts
- The typology assumes posts are primarily from students, though some may be from staff or prospective students
- The coding prioritizes the explicit content of the post title, as that was the only information available to coders
